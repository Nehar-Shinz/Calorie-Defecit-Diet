## 🚀 The Backstory

I started with a simple goal: create a calorie deficit meal plan for myself. But then I thought, "Hey, why not make it into a snazzy webpage that looks like a cookbook?" 🤷‍♂️ So, I whipped up some AI-generated images using Microsoft Bing Image Creator to make it look all fancy and professional. And voilà, here we are!

This project is my way of having fun with my diet plan. It’s not meant to be a serious health guide, just a playful experiment. So, please remember: this isn’t professional diet advice, and I’m not responsible for anyone who decides to follow it. 😄
